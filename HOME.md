# Background
* Consumers often buy more groceries than they can responsibly consume.
* When consumers waste food, they also waste other natural resources.
* Food waste accounts for:
    * 1/3 of all human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and
    * 8% of all global GHG emissions annually (Lewis, 2022).
* On average, the American consumer wastes around $1,300 on food annually (Conrad, 2020).

# Problem
Consumers lack the necessary tools to track their food inventory, which not only puts an unnecessary burden on their finances but also causes a significant negative impact on the environment.

# Problem Characteristics
* Remembering all the purchased food can be overwhelming.
* Keeping track of current inventory, shopping lists, and frequency of purchases separately or not at all is not efficient.
* Consumers often struggle to plan meals effectively without an accurate inventory of food.
